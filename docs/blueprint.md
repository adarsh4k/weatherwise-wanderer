# **App Name**: WeatherWise Wanderer

## Core Features:

- User Location and Date Input: Allow users to input location via manual text entry with location suggestions, and the option for fetching current location. Also allow users to select a date to check historical weather data.
- NASA Data Integration and Probability Calculation: Fetch historical weather data from NASA POWER API and calculate probabilities of extreme conditions (hot, cold, wet, windy, uncomfortable).
- Personalized Activity Recommendations: Provide personalized activity recommendations based on computed probabilities and user-selected activity.  The recommendations use a reasoning tool.
- Dashboard Visualization: Display probabilities using bar or donut charts, temperature distribution via bell curve, and historical trends on a modern, responsive dashboard.
- Data Export: Enable users to download weather probabilities, conditions and activity recommendations, with associated metadata, in JSON and CSV formats.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to reflect the weather-focused nature of the app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a very desaturated and bright version of the primary color, provides a neutral backdrop to maintain readability and focus on content.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight key interactive elements and call to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure readability and a modern, approachable design.
- Use weather-themed icons (sun, rain, wind) to visually represent different conditions.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile) for optimal viewing experience.
- Smooth transitions and animations when displaying weather probabilities and recommendations.
